    "**Week 10: Regression Diagnostics and Remedies**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "This week is devoted to regression diagnostics and remedies. We'll look at how to conduct residual analysis and detect outliers, and discuss strategies for dealing with these issues. We'll also discuss how and when to apply transformations for variance stabilization. Python will be used for demonstrating these concepts.\n",
